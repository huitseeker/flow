# Introduction

The contracts used in the Cluster Quorum Certificate (QC) and Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocols
emit events whenever an important action is performed.

# Introduction

The Cluster Quorum Certificate (QC) and Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol smart contracts
store a lot of different state, and the state is constantly changing.
As an external party, there are two ways to keep track of these state changes. 
You can either use Cadence scripts to query the state of the contract at any given time,
or you can monitor events that are emitted by the contracts to be notified of any important occurances.

# Query Information with Scripts

These events can be queried using the Go or JavaScript SDKs to extract useful notifications and information about the
state of these processes.
